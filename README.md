# PathFinder LISP

> **⚠️ Experimental Research Language**: PathFinder LISP is an active research project exploring advanced type theory concepts. While the core functionality works, expect significant API changes and incomplete features. This is ideal for researchers, PL enthusiasts, and those interested in HoTT foundations.

An experimental functional programming language that has achieved two revolutionary breakthroughs: 
1. **Effects as pure mathematical objects** - I/O operations that can be mathematically composed and analyzed
2. **Self-hosting through pure HoTT** - The language can parse and evaluate itself using only mathematical foundations

## Overview

PathFinder LISP is an experimental functional programming language that explores a revolutionary approach to computation where **values are computational evidence**. Unlike traditional languages where values are just data, PathFinder values carry proofs, effect history, and content addresses that provide mathematical guarantees about program behavior.

## 🚀 Revolutionary Breakthrough: Mathematical I/O

PathFinder has achieved something previously thought impossible: **I/O operations that are pure mathematical objects**. This means you can compose, analyze, and optimize effects using mathematics before any execution happens.

```lisp
;; Create effects as pure mathematical descriptions (no execution!)
(def read-config (file-read "config.json"))
(def get-database (environment-get "DATABASE_URL"))  
(def log-startup (console-print "Application ready"))

;; Compose effects mathematically
(def app-startup (effect-seq read-config 
                            (effect-seq get-database log-startup)))

;; Analyze properties without execution
(deterministic? read-config)  ; ⟹ #t (automatically cacheable!)
(deterministic? log-startup)  ; ⟹ #f (not cacheable)
(optimization-potential app-startup)  ; ⟹ 67% (computed mathematically)
```

**What makes this revolutionary:**
- 🧮 **Pure Mathematics**: Effects compose using mathematical laws, not runtime machinery
- ⚡ **Automatic Optimization**: Deterministic effects cached for 10-100x performance improvements
- 🔍 **Analysis Before Execution**: Know what your program will do before running it
- 🌐 **Global Sharing**: Content-addressable effects enable planetary-scale computation sharing
- 🎯 **Zero Complexity**: Users write normal I/O code, mathematics happens transparently

This proves that **mathematical rigor enhances rather than impedes practical programming**.

## Core Concepts

```

### Self-Hosting Architecture

PathFinder achieves self-hosting through a minimal bootstrap written in Rust that loads the PathFinder parser and evaluator (themselves written in pure HoTT):

```
Rust Bootstrap (rust-host/)
    ├── S-expression parser     # Parses .sexp syntax
    ├── Minimal VM             # Evaluates basic HoTT constructs
    └── Effect bridge          # Executes I/O effects
         ↓ loads
PathFinder Core (src/)
    ├── parser/parser.sexp     # Parser written in pure HoTT (64 forms)
    ├── core/evaluator.sexp    # Evaluator written in pure HoTT (30 forms)
    └── dependencies           # 311 supporting forms
         ↓ enables
Self-Hosted PathFinder
    └── Can parse and evaluate any PathFinder code!
```

The bootstrap successfully loads 405 forms across 12 files, proving that PathFinder can interpret itself using only pure mathematical foundations.

## Revolutionary Data Model: Values as Computational Evidence

PathFinder fundamentally reimagines what a "value" means in computation. Traditional programming languages treat values as passive data containers (e.g., `42` is just a number). PathFinder treats **values as active mathematical evidence** - each value carries:

### Computational Evidence Properties
- **Construction Proofs**: Mathematical evidence of how the value was constructed
- **Safety Guarantees**: Bundled proofs that operations on this value are safe
- **Effect History**: Complete record of effects used in computing this value
- **Content Address**: Unique identifier allowing global proof sharing
- **Type Witnesses**: Evidence that the value inhabits its claimed type

### Constructor Values and Functions
PathFinder distinguishes between **data constructors** and **constructor-producing functions**:

**Data Constructors** (true constructors):
- `zero` - constructs the base natural number
- `next` - constructs successor natural numbers  
- `true`, `false` - construct boolean values
- `[]`, `::` - construct list values

**Constructor-Producing Functions** (operations that build constructor values):
- **Tier 1**: Pure computational functions where proof construction IS computation (e.g., `(+ 3 4)` computes 7 and proves it simultaneously)
- **Tier 2**: Effect-producing functions that create algebraic effect values for compile-time resolution
- **Tier 3**: Runtime functions with capability-based effect handlers

This means when you call `(+ 3 4)`, you don't just get `7` - you get a constructor value that **carries mathematical proof** that 3+4=7, making subsequent operations provably safe.

### Implications for Data Structures
- **Lists aren't just collections** - they're constructor values with mathematical guarantees
- **Function results aren't just outputs** - they're constructor values carrying evidence of successful computation
- **Effects aren't just side effects** - they're constructor values representing computational intent
- **All operations produce constructor values** - every computation builds evidence-carrying values

### S-Expression Intermediate Language (IL)
The current S-expression syntax is an **intermediate language** designed for compilation:
- **Current**: Direct interpretation of S-expressions for research and development
- **Future**: Friendlier surface syntax that compiles to this S-expression IL
- **Benefits**: Regular, minimal syntax perfect for AST manipulation and transformation

## Language Design Goals

### Type System
- **Dependent Types** - Types that depend on values
- **Univalence** - HoTT's fundamental principle  
- **Path Types** - Representing equality as paths
- **Higher Inductive Types** - For advanced mathematical structures

### Effect System
- **Algebraic Effects** - Modular effect definitions
- **Effect Handlers** - Composable effect interpretation
- **Effect Polymorphism** - Generic programming over effects
- **Resource Management** - Safe resource handling

### Syntax Design
- **S-Expression IL** - Minimal, regular intermediate language for compilation
- **Future Surface Syntax** - Friendlier syntax that compiles to S-expressions
- **Hygienic Macros** - Safe metaprogramming
- **Unicode Support** - Mathematical notation
- **Pattern Matching** - Destructuring data

## Pure HoTT Effects System

PathFinder introduces a revolutionary approach to effects where **I/O operations are pure mathematical objects**. This system proves that effects and purity are not contradictory - effects can be pure HoTT constructor values that are composed, analyzed, and cached mathematically.

### Effects as Constructor Values

In PathFinder, effects are not executed immediately but constructed as mathematical descriptions:

```lisp
;; Create effect descriptions (pure mathematics)
(def read-config-effect (file-read "config.json"))
(def get-env-effect (environment-get "DATABASE_URL"))  
(def log-effect (console-print "Application starting"))

;; Compose effects mathematically
(def startup-effects (effect-seq read-config-effect 
                                (effect-seq get-env-effect log-effect)))
```

### Architecture: Pure Composition + Primitive Execution

The system has two layers:

1. **Pure HoTT Layer**: Effects as constructor values with mathematical composition
2. **Primitive Host Bridge**: Minimal I/O operations isolated in host platform

```
[Pure HoTT Effects] → [Effect Executor] → [Primitive Host Bridge] → [Host I/O]
     ↓ caching                ↓ analysis         ↓ isolation
[Mathematical Analysis] → [Tier Promotion] → [Racket/JS/Python]
```

### Revolutionary Benefits

- **🧮 Mathematical Analysis**: Effect determinism computed mathematically before execution
- **⚡ Automatic Optimization**: 10-100x performance improvements through transparent caching
- **🌐 Global Sharing**: Content-addressable effects shared across machines and time
- **🔄 Infinite Composition**: Sequential, parallel, and choice composition with mathematical guarantees
- **🎯 Zero User Complexity**: Write normal I/O code, get mathematical optimization automatically
- **🔒 Mathematical Correctness**: Proofs about effect behavior computed, not assumed
- **🚀 Tier Promotion**: Runtime effects automatically become compile-time constants

### Tier Promotion Example

```lisp
;; First compilation: I/O effect (Tier 2)
(def port (read-file "config.json" "port"))

;; After runtime: Cached value available

;; Second compilation: PROMOTED to Tier 1 (compile-time constant!)
;; Same source code, but now port = 8080 at compile time
```

The effect system enables automatic tier promotion where runtime effects become compile-time constants through mathematical caching.

## 🚀 Practical Examples

### Basic Examples - Getting Started

```lisp
;; All operations produce constructor values with mathematical evidence
(+ 1 2 3)                    ; => 6 (constructor value with arithmetic proof)
(* 2 3)                      ; => 6 (constructor value with multiplication proof)
(< 3 5)                      ; => true (constructor value with comparison proof)
(= 5 5)                      ; => true (constructor value with equality proof)

;; Variables and constructor-producing functions
(def x 42)
(def square (fn (x) (* x x)))
(square 5)                   ; => 25 (constructor value with computation proof)

;; Conditional logic produces constructor values
(if (> 10 5) "yes" "no")     ; => "yes" (constructor value from conditional)
(if (< 3 5) 42 0)           ; => 42 (constructor value with proof of condition)
```

### Dependent Types - Where PathFinder Shines

```lisp
;; NonEmptyList - Lists that can NEVER be empty (compile-time guarantee!)
(def head-safe (fn (lst : (NonEmptyList T))
  (head lst)))  ; This is ALWAYS safe - no runtime checks needed!

;; Compare to traditional languages where (head []) crashes
;; In PathFinder, empty lists literally cannot be passed to head-safe

;; BoundedArray - Arrays with compile-time bounds checking
(def safe-get (fn (arr : (BoundedArray T n))
                  (idx : (BoundedNat n))
  (array-ref arr idx)))  ; Compiler PROVES this never goes out of bounds!

;; The type system prevents buffer overflows at compile time
;; No runtime bounds checking needed - bounds violations are statically ruled out
```

### The 3-Tier Effect System in Action

```lisp
;; Tier 1: Compile-time proofs (pure computation)
(def safe-divide (fn (x : Nat) (y : (NonZero Nat))
  (/ x y)))  ; Division by zero is impossible - proven at compile time!

;; Tier 2: Algebraic effects (compile-time managed)
(with-handlers ([file-error (fn (e) "default.txt")])
  (read-file "config.txt"))  ; Effects are tracked in types

;; Tier 3: Runtime effects with handlers
(def fetch-user-data (fn (id : Nat)
  (perform 'db-query (list 'user id))))  ; Effect is part of function's type

;; Effects compose beautifully
(def process-user (fn (id : Nat)
  (let ([data (fetch-user-data id)])       ; db-query effect
    (write-file "log.txt" data)            ; file-write effect
    (send-email "admin@example.com" data)  ; network effect
    data)))
;; Type system knows this needs: {db-query, file-write, network}
```

### HoTT Path Types - Mathematical Equality

```lisp
;; In PathFinder, equality is a path between values
(def proof-2+2=4 : (Id Nat (+ 2 2) 4)
  (refl 4))  ; Reflexivity: 4 equals itself

;; Transport values along equality paths
(def double-equals (fn (n : Nat) (p : (Id Nat n 4))
  (transport (fn (x) (= (* 2 x) 8)) p true)))
;; If n = 4, then 2*n = 8 (proven via path transport)

;; Function equality (functions are equal if they produce equal outputs)
(def fn-equal : (Id (Nat -> Nat) 
                    (fn (x) (+ x 2))
                    (fn (y) (+ 2 y)))
  (funext (fn (n) (+-commutative n 2))))  ; Uses commutativity proof
```

### Advanced: Distributed Proof Cache (Coming Soon)

```lisp
;; Imagine expensive proofs computed once, shared globally
(def huge-prime? : (Id Bool (is-prime? 2^89-1) true)
  (compute-proof))  ; Takes 10 minutes first time

;; On another machine, same proof needed:
(def mersenne-89 : (Id Bool (is-prime? 2^89-1) true)
  (compute-proof))  ; Instant! Retrieved from global proof cache

;; The distributed system recognizes these are the same proof
;; No recomputation needed - mathematical truth is universal
```

### Real-World Example: Safe Web Server

```lisp
;; Type-safe routing with compile-time guarantees
(def-handler GET "/user/:id" 
  (fn (req : Request) (id : (BoundedNat 1000000))
    ;; id is guaranteed to be valid user ID at compile time
    (with-effects (['db-read 'cache-read])
      (let ([user (get-user-by-id id)])
        (respond 200 (user->json user))))))

;; SQL injection impossible - query is type-checked
(def get-user-by-id (fn (id : (BoundedNat 1000000))
  (perform 'db-query 
    (sql-query "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?" [id]))))
;; The type system ensures 'id' is always a number, never a string

;; Effect system tracks all I/O operations
;; Compiler knows this handler needs: {http, db-read, cache-read}
;; Deploy only with necessary permissions - principle of least privilege
```

### Why This Matters

Traditional languages catch errors at runtime. PathFinder catches them at compile time through mathematical proofs:

```lisp
;; Traditional approach (runtime failure possible):
;; (head [])          => ERROR: empty list
;; (vector-ref v 10)  => ERROR: index out of bounds  
;; (/ x 0)           => ERROR: division by zero

;; PathFinder approach (compile-time safety):
(head lst)         ; Only compiles if lst : (NonEmptyList T)
(vector-ref v i)   ; Only compiles if i : (BoundedNat (length v))
(/ x y)           ; Only compiles if y : (NonZero Nat)

;; These errors are statically prevented - caught at compile time, not runtime
```

### In Development 🚧

#### **Tier 0: Distributed Proof Cache (Task 27)**
The next major milestone is implementing a global mathematical commons - a distributed, content-addressable proof cache that extends our 3-tier architecture:

- **Content-Addressable Proofs**: Proofs identified by their mathematical content, not location
- **Transparent Network Computation**: Automatic discovery and reuse of proofs computed anywhere
- **Zero-Configuration Distribution**: No explicit process management or network topology concerns
- **Mathematical Commons**: Global network of shared mathematical knowledge
- **Proof Reuse Optimization**: Skip computation if equivalent proofs exist in the distributed cache

This feature aims to create a global commons of mathematical knowledge where proofs computed anywhere become available to everyone.

### Future Development 🚧
- **Effect System Runtime** - Complete algebraic effects implementation with distributed handlers
