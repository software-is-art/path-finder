⏺ Yes, we can definitely lower our IR to MLIR! This would actually be an excellent choice for several reasons:

  Why MLIR is a Great Fit for PathFinder

  1. Evidence Maps to MLIR Attributes

  MLIR's attribute system can directly represent our evidence:
  // PathFinder IR with evidence
  func.func @double(%arg0: !pathfinder.nat) -> !pathfinder.nat
      attributes {
        termination_evidence = #pathfinder.immediate<steps = 1>,
        complexity_evidence = #pathfinder.constant<ops = 2>,
        space_evidence = #pathfinder.constant<size = 0>
      } {
    %0 = pathfinder.succ %arg0 : !pathfinder.nat
    %1 = pathfinder.succ %0 : !pathfinder.nat
    return %1 : !pathfinder.nat
  }

  2. Multi-Level Optimization

  MLIR's dialect system allows us to lower gradually:
  - PathFinder Dialect → Affine/SCF → LLVM → Native code
  - PathFinder Dialect → JavaScript Dialect → JS
  - PathFinder Dialect → WASM Dialect → WebAssembly

  3. HoTT Constructs as Custom Dialect

  We can create a PathFinder MLIR dialect that preserves our HoTT semantics:
  pathfinder.nat_elim %motive, %base, %step, %target :
    (!pathfinder.type, !pathfinder.value, !pathfinder.closure, !pathfinder.nat) -> !pathfinder.value

  4. Built-in Optimization Infrastructure

  MLIR provides:
  - Pattern rewriting framework (perfect for our evidence-based optimizations)
  - Pass management
  - Verification infrastructure
  - Multiple target backends (LLVM, CUDA, Vulkan, etc.)

  Modified Plan with MLIR

  Instead of implementing JavaScript and WASM backends directly, we could:

  Phase 2 Alternative: MLIR Integration

  2.1 PathFinder MLIR Dialect (src/compiler/backends/mlir-dialect.sexp)

  - Define PathFinder types in MLIR
  - Map our IR operations to MLIR ops
  - Preserve evidence as attributes
  - Define lowering patterns

  2.2 IR to MLIR Lowering (src/compiler/backends/mlir-lowering.sexp)

  - Convert IRModule → MLIR Module
  - Map evidence to attributes
  - Generate dialect-specific operations
  - Preserve HoTT semantics

  2.3 Optimization Patterns (src/compiler/backends/mlir-patterns.sexp)

  - Evidence-guided pattern rewrites
  - Leverage MLIR's pattern infrastructure
  - Connect to existing MLIR passes

  2.4 Multi-Target Generation

  - Use MLIR's existing backends:
    - LLVM: For native code
    - SPIRV: For GPU compute
    - Async: For effect handling
  - Add custom lowerings:
    - JavaScript: Via MLIR → custom JS emitter
    - WASM: Via MLIR → LLVM → WASM

  Benefits of MLIR Approach

  1. Reuse Existing Infrastructure: Don't reinvent optimization passes
  2. Multiple Targets for Free: LLVM, GPU, TPU support out of the box
  3. Better Debugging: MLIR has excellent visualization tools
  4. Industry Standard: Growing ecosystem and tool support
  5. Verification: MLIR's verification infrastructure ensures correctness

  Example Lowering Pipeline

  PathFinder Source
      ↓ (Parser)
  PathFinder AST
      ↓ (Our IR translation)
  PathFinder IR with Evidence
      ↓ (MLIR Lowering)
  PathFinder MLIR Dialect
      ↓ (Dialect Conversion)
  Standard MLIR Dialects (Affine, SCF, Std)
      ↓ (Target-specific lowering)
  LLVM IR / JavaScript / WASM

  This approach would make PathFinder's compiler much more powerful while reducing the implementation burden. We'd focus on the PathFinder-specific aspects (evidence, HoTT semantics)
  while leveraging MLIR's robust infrastructure for the rest.

  Would you like me to revise the plan to use MLIR as our compilation target instead of implementing backends directly?

> Yes I think this is a solid plan. We should also keep in mind how this will affect our runtime-at-compile time optimisations. Because we can cache computation from runtime to use at
   compile time - we may be able to express this in MLIR too?

✻ Thinking…

  The user is asking about runtime-at-compile-time optimizations and how they can be expressed in MLIR. This is a really interesting aspect of PathFinder's design - the ability to
  cache computations from runtime and use them during compilation. This fits well with MLIR's capabilities.

  Let me think about how this would work:

  1. PathFinder's computation-as-effect model means every computation carries evidence
  2. We can evaluate pure computations at compile time and cache the results
  3. MLIR has constant folding and compile-time evaluation capabilities
  4. MLIR's dialect system allows custom interpretation/evaluation rules

  The key insight is that PathFinder's evidence system can guide when it's safe to evaluate at compile time, and MLIR's infrastructure can help us implement this efficiently.

⏺ Absolutely! This is a brilliant insight. MLIR is actually perfectly suited for PathFinder's runtime-at-compile-time optimization strategy. Here's how we can express this:

  Runtime-at-Compile-Time in MLIR

  1. MLIR's Compile-Time Evaluation Infrastructure

  MLIR already has mechanisms for compile-time computation:

  // PathFinder dialect with compile-time evaluation
  pathfinder.compute_at_compile_time {
    %0 = pathfinder.nat_value 1000
    %1 = pathfinder.nat_value 2000
    %2 = pathfinder.add %0, %1 : !pathfinder.nat
    pathfinder.cache %2 as @compile_time_3000 : !pathfinder.nat
  }

  // Later use the cached value
  func.func @use_cached() -> !pathfinder.nat {
    %0 = pathfinder.cached_value @compile_time_3000 : !pathfinder.nat
    return %0 : !pathfinder.nat
  }

  2. Evidence-Guided Compile-Time Execution

  We can use evidence to determine what's safe to evaluate at compile time:

  // Operation with evidence that it's pure and terminates quickly
  %result = pathfinder.nat_elim %motive, %base, %step, %target
    {termination = #pathfinder.immediate<steps = 10>,
     pure = true,
     deterministic = true} : (...) -> !pathfinder.nat

  // MLIR pass can evaluate this at compile time because evidence proves it's safe

  3. Content-Addressable Cache in MLIR

  PathFinder's content-addressable caching maps beautifully to MLIR:

  module attributes {pathfinder.computation_cache = #pathfinder.cache<[
    // Hash of computation -> result
    #pathfinder.cache_entry<"hash_of_fib_10", 55>,
    #pathfinder.cache_entry<"hash_of_factorial_5", 120>
  ]>} {
    // Functions can reference cached computations
    func.func @use_cached_fib() -> !pathfinder.nat {
      %0 = pathfinder.lookup_cache "hash_of_fib_10" : !pathfinder.nat
      return %0 : !pathfinder.nat
    }
  }

  4. Progressive Evaluation with MLIR Transforms

  MLIR's pass infrastructure lets us implement progressive evaluation:

  // Initial IR - symbolic computation
  func.func @factorial(%n: !pathfinder.nat) -> !pathfinder.nat {
    %0 = pathfinder.nat_elim @factorial_motive, @factorial_base, @factorial_step, %n
    return %0 : !pathfinder.nat
  }

  // After partial evaluation pass (if n is known to be 5)
  func.func @factorial() -> !pathfinder.nat {
    %0 = pathfinder.const_nat 120 : !pathfinder.nat  // Computed at compile time!
    return %0 : !pathfinder.nat
  }

  5. Metacircular Optimization Loop in MLIR

  The really powerful part - we can express PathFinder's self-optimization in MLIR:

  module @pathfinder_compiler {
    // The compiler analyzing itself
    func.func @analyze_self() -> !pathfinder.evidence {
      %0 = pathfinder.reflect_on_module @pathfinder_compiler
      %1 = pathfinder.analyze_complexity %0
      %2 = pathfinder.generate_optimized_version %0, %1
      pathfinder.cache_and_replace %2  // Replace self with optimized version!
    }
  }

  Revised Plan: MLIR-Based Runtime-at-Compile-Time

  Phase 2.5: Compile-Time Execution Infrastructure

  2.5.1 PathFinder Interpreter in MLIR (src/compiler/backends/mlir-interpreter.sexp)

  - Implement PathFinder semantics as MLIR folder operations
  - Use evidence to determine evaluation safety
  - Cache results with content-addressing

  2.5.2 Partial Evaluation Pass (src/compiler/backends/mlir-partial-eval.sexp)

  - Identify computations that can be evaluated at compile time
  - Use evidence thresholds (e.g., terminate in < 1000 steps)
  - Replace computations with cached results

  2.5.3 Cache Management (src/compiler/backends/mlir-cache.sexp)

  - Integrate with PathFinder's content-addressable store
  - Serialize evaluated results as MLIR attributes
  - Load cache from previous compilations

  Example: Fibonacci at Compile Time

  ;; PathFinder source
  (define fib
    (fn (n)
      (nat-elim (fn (_) Nat)
                one                    ; fib(0) = 1
                (fn (pred rec)         ; fib(n+1) = ...
                  (nat-elim (fn (_) Nat)
                            one        ; fib(1) = 1
                            (fn (p2 r2) (add rec r2))  ; fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
                            pred))
                n)))

  ;; If called with constant
  (define fib-10 (fib (nat-from-int 10)))

  This would compile to:

  // Initial MLIR
  %fib_10 = pathfinder.apply @fib, %const_10 : (!pathfinder.nat) -> !pathfinder.nat

  // After compile-time evaluation pass
  %fib_10 = pathfinder.const_nat 89 : !pathfinder.nat  // Computed at compile time!

  Key Benefits

  1. Zero Runtime Overhead: Complex computations become constants
  2. Progressive Optimization: Each compilation makes the next faster
  3. Evidence-Guided: Only evaluate what's provably safe
  4. Cache Reuse: Previous compilations speed up future ones
  5. Self-Improving: The compiler optimizes itself using the same mechanism

  This approach makes PathFinder's metacircular compilation extremely powerful - we're not just generating better code, we're actually running parts of the program at compile time
  when it's safe to do so, guided by mathematical evidence.
