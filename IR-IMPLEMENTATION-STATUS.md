# PathFinder IR Implementation Status

## Overview
We have successfully implemented the foundation of PathFinder's HoTT-native Intermediate Representation (IR) system. This IR preserves computational evidence throughout compilation and enables safe, mathematically-grounded optimizations.

## Completed Components

### 1. **IR Core Data Types** (`src/compiler/ir/core.sexp`)
- **IRValue**: Represents values with evidence annotations
  - Constants (nat, bool, string, unit)
  - Variables with De Bruijn indices
  - Constructors with termination evidence
  - Closures with complexity evidence
- **IRComputation**: Represents computations that may have effects
  - Let bindings with space evidence
  - Function applications with computation evidence
  - Eliminators (nat-elim, bool-elim) with termination proofs
  - Conditionals with branch prediction evidence
- **IREffect**: First-class representation of effects
- **IRModule**: Module-level definitions with aggregate evidence

### 2. **IR Builder Utilities** (`src/compiler/ir/builder.sexp`)
- Smart constructors that automatically infer evidence
- Complexity and space analysis functions
- Environment management helpers
- Evidence aggregation for modules

### 3. **IR Pretty Printer** (`src/compiler/ir/printer.sexp`)
- Human-readable output for all IR constructs
- Configurable evidence display
- Proper indentation and formatting
- Module-level pretty printing

### 4. **IR Validator** (`src/compiler/ir/validator.sexp`)
- Ensures IR invariants are maintained
- Validates variable bindings and indices
- Checks evidence well-formedness
- Module-level validation with error accumulation

### 5. **AST to IR Translation** (`src/compiler/ast-to-ir.sexp`)
- Converts PathFinder AST to evidence-preserving IR
- Handles all basic constructs:
  - Literals and variables
  - Functions and applications
  - Let bindings and conditionals
  - Pattern matching (via eliminators)
  - Effects and perform expressions
- Maintains proper De Bruijn indices
- Infers initial evidence annotations

### 6. **Constant Folding Optimization** (`src/compiler/passes/constant-fold.sexp`)
- First optimization pass demonstrating evidence-aware transformation
- Evaluates pure computations at compile time
- Folds conditionals with constant conditions
- Propagates constants through let bindings
- Preserves evidence throughout optimization

## Key Design Decisions

### Evidence-First Design
Every IR node carries evidence about its computational properties:
- **Termination**: Proof that computation terminates
- **Complexity**: Bounds on time complexity
- **Space**: Memory usage characteristics
- **Effects**: Purity and determinism information

### De Bruijn Indices
Variables use De Bruijn indices for correct scoping and easy substitution during optimization.

### Separate Values and Computations
Clear distinction between:
- **Values**: Can be evaluated immediately
- **Computations**: May have effects or require evaluation

### Module-Level Evidence
Modules aggregate evidence from all definitions, enabling whole-program optimization.

## Example IR

Here's what a simple function looks like in our IR:

```
(define double
  : (Nat -> Nat)
  (Î» n . (succ (succ n@0)) #evidence=comp-evidence))
```

After constant folding on `(double (succ (succ zero)))`:
```
(ir-return (constructor "succ" (constructor "succ" 
  (constructor "succ" (constructor "succ" zero)))))
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Week 1)

   - Dead code elimination
   - Inlining based on evidence
   - Effect fusion
   
2. **Backend Code Generation**
   - IR to JavaScript
   - IR to WASM
   - Enhanced Rust generation

3. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - IR round-trip tests
   - Optimization correctness tests
   - Performance benchmarks

### Medium Term (Weeks 2-3)
1. **Advanced Optimizations**
   - Loop optimization using termination evidence
   - Tail call optimization
   - Memory optimization using space evidence

2. **Debugger Support**
   - Source mapping from IR to original code
   - Evidence visualization
   - Step-through IR evaluation

3. **Integration**
   - Connect IR to existing code generator
   - Update self-compilation script
   - Bootstrap with new IR

### Long Term (Week 4+)
1. **Verified Optimization**
   - Prove optimization correctness in HoTT
   - Generate optimization certificates
   - Self-verifying compiler

2. **Performance**
   - Parallel optimization passes
   - Incremental compilation
   - Profile-guided optimization using evidence

## Summary
The IR implementation provides a solid foundation for PathFinder's metacircular compilation goals. By preserving evidence throughout compilation, we enable optimizations that are both powerful and provably correct. The clean separation of concerns and modular design make it easy to add new optimization passes and backends.

The next phase will focus on leveraging this IR to achieve true self-optimization, where PathFinder compiles itself to increasingly efficient code while maintaining mathematical correctness.
