# Task ID: 27
# Title: Implement Tier 0 Distributed Proof Cache
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 18, 20, 25
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a distributed, content-addressable proof cache that acts as a 'Tier 0' in the architecture. This system will transparently resolve proof obligations by searching a network of pre-computed proofs before falling back to local computation, effectively creating a global mathematical commons.
# Details:
This task establishes a new architectural tier, "Tier 0", for distributed, pre-computed proofs, making the network an invisible acceleration layer.

**1. Content-Addressable Proof Obligation Hashing:**
   - Develop a canonical serialization format for proof obligations generated by the constraint system (Task 18).
   - The serialization must be stable and independent of variable names (e.g., using de Bruijn indices) to ensure that logically equivalent obligations produce identical hashes.
   - This hash will serve as the unique key for retrieving proofs from any cache (local or distributed).

**2. Transparent Proof Resolution Pipeline:**
   - Integrate a new resolution pipeline into the core proof search mechanism (Task 20).
   - When a proof is required, the system will attempt to resolve it in the following order:
     1. Query the distributed cache over the network.
     2. Query the local, on-disk cache.
     3. Attempt to solve using Tier 1 compile-time mechanisms (e.g., computational reflection from Task 25).
     4. Defer to Tier 2 runtime checks if applicable.
     5. Fall back to network coordination for complex proofs if all else fails.

**3. Distributed Cache and Network Protocol:**
   - Implement a peer-to-peer mechanism for nodes to discover and share proofs.
   - Define a simple network protocol for querying peers for a proof by its obligation hash.
   - When a peer generates a new, expensive proof, it should be added to its local cache and made available to the network.

**4. Automatic Verification and Caching:**
   - Any proof retrieved from any source (local or distributed) must be formally verified against the original proof obligation before being used.
   - Once a proof is successfully generated locally or verified from a remote source, it should be automatically stored in a local on-disk cache to accelerate future requests.

# Test Strategy:
**1. Hashing Stability Test:**
   - Create multiple test cases where proof obligations are structurally identical but use different variable names or syntactic forms.
   - Verify that the canonical hashing mechanism produces the exact same hash for all equivalent obligations.

**2. Resolution Pipeline Test:**
   - Define a computationally expensive but decidable proposition (e.g., using functions from Task 25).
   - First compilation: Verify that the proof is generated using local computation (e.g., reflection) and measure the time taken.
   - Clear the in-memory cache and re-compile: Verify the proof is now loaded from the local on-disk cache, resulting in a significantly faster time.

**3. Distributed Cache Test:**
   - Set up two running instances of the system (Peer A and Peer B) on a local network.
   - On Peer A, compile code that generates and caches an expensive proof.
   - On Peer B, compile code that requires the identical proof.
   - Monitor network traffic and logs to confirm that Peer B successfully queries and retrieves the proof from Peer A without performing the expensive computation itself.

**4. Proof Verification Test:**
   - Manually inject a malformed or incorrect proof term into the cache of Peer A for a valid proof obligation hash.
   - Have Peer B request this proof.
   - Verify that Peer B rejects the invalid proof upon receipt because it fails the verification step, and then proceeds to the next stage of the resolution pipeline (local computation).

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Canonical Serialization and Hashing for Proof Obligations [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a stable, canonical serialization format for proof obligations from the constraint system. This serialization must be independent of incidental details like variable names to ensure logically equivalent obligations produce identical hashes. This hash will be the content-addressable key for the cache.
### Details:
Use a technique like de Bruijn indexing to abstract away variable names during serialization. The serialization format should be a well-defined, compact byte stream (e.g., using a library like MessagePack or a custom binary format). The final output should be a cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA-256) of this byte stream. This function will be a prerequisite for all caching operations.

## 2. Create a Local On-Disk Proof Cache [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a local, persistent cache on the file system to store and retrieve computed proofs. The cache will use the proof obligation hash as the key, enabling fast local lookups.
### Details:
The cache should be stored in a standard user cache directory (e.g., `~/.cache/my_system/proofs/`). Proofs should be stored in files named after their obligation hash (e.g., `<hash>.proof`). Implement functions for `put(hash, proof_data)` and `get(hash) -> Option<proof_data>`. Handle file I/O, including creating the directory structure if it doesn't exist.

## 3. Integrate Local Cache Lookup into the Proof Resolution Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Modify the core proof search mechanism to query the local on-disk cache before attempting to generate a proof. If a proof is generated locally, it should be stored in the cache for future use.
### Details:
In the proof search function (from Task 20), first, generate the hash of the proof obligation using the function from subtask #28. Second, attempt to retrieve the proof from the local cache using the `get` function from subtask #29. If a proof is found (cache hit), return it. If not (cache miss), proceed with the existing proof generation logic. Upon successful generation of a new proof, use the `put` function from subtask #29 to store it in the local cache.

## 4. Define and Implement a Peer-to-Peer Proof Query Protocol [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement a simple P2P network protocol for nodes to query each other for proofs by hash. This includes both the client-side logic to send a request and the server-side logic to listen for and respond to requests from its local cache.
### Details:
Define two primary message types: `QUERY <hash>` and `PROOF <hash> <proof_data>`. A node should listen on a configured port for incoming `QUERY` messages. Upon receiving a query, it should check its local on-disk cache (from subtask #29) for the corresponding proof. If found, it responds with a `PROOF` message. The client logic will involve connecting to a list of known peers and sending a `QUERY` message.

## 5. Integrate Distributed Lookup and Verification into the Resolution Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Enhance the proof resolution pipeline to query the network for a proof as the first step. Crucially, any proof received from the network must be formally verified against the obligation before being used or cached locally.
### Details:
Modify the pipeline from subtask #30. The new resolution order will be: 1. Query network peers (using the client from subtask #31). 2. If a proof is received, verify it against the original obligation. If valid, use it and store it in the local cache. 3. If no proof is found on the network or the received proof is invalid, proceed with the existing logic (check local cache, then compute). The verification step is critical for security and correctness.
