# Overview
PathFinder LISP is a statically-typed, functional programming language with a LISP-based syntax that brings the power and safety of Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) to practical software development. It treats types as mathematical spaces with inherent notions of equality (paths) and equivalence, providing exceptionally strong compile-time guarantees. Each type definition inherently specifies a single, canonical way to construct an instance (Canonical Instantiation Function - CIF), with type construction being a computational effect managed through an algebraic effect system. The language targets programming language researchers, developers working on high-assurance systems, and those familiar with advanced functional programming and type theory.

# Core Features
**HoTT-Based Type System**
- Types as mathematical spaces with values as "points" in these spaces
- Equality as paths (Id A x y) - equality propositions are types themselves
- Functions as continuous maps that preserve path structure between types
- Direct support for dependent types, universes, product types, sum types, and identity types
- Univalence axiom support: isomorphic types are equal

**Canonical Instantiation Functions (CIFs)**
- Every type has exactly one primary way to be instantiated using the type name as constructor
- Type instantiation is a computational effect that can fail or invoke other effects
- Effect polymorphism: CIFs can be pure when constraints are encoded in dependent types, effectful when runtime checking is needed
- Automatic inference of pure vs effectful CIFs based on constraints and underlying structures
- Built-in ConstructionFailure effect for constraint violations when proofs are unavailable
- Gradual transition from runtime checks to compile-time proofs as constraint encoding improves

**Effect Polymorphism in Detail**
CIFs support effect polymorphism, allowing the same type constructor to be either pure or effectful depending on available constraint proofs:

Basic Example - NonEmptyVec:
```
; Traditional approach - always effectful
(deftype NonEmptyVec ((A : Type) (n : Nat))
    (Array A)
    (:where (not (Id Nat n Nat.zero))))

; Enhanced approach - effect polymorphic
(deftype NonEmptyVec ((A : Type) (n : Nat))
    (Array A)
    (:constraint-proof (p : (not (Id Nat n Nat.zero))))
    (:performs-when-unproven (ConstructionFailure)))
```

Usage patterns demonstrate the polymorphism:
```
; Pure usage - proof trivially available
(NonEmptyVec Int (Nat.succ Nat.zero))  ; No effects, no try/catch needed

; Effectful usage - proof unavailable at compile time
(try (NonEmptyVec Int user-input-nat)
     (:catch (e : ConstructionError) fallback-handling))

; Explicit proof usage - pure with complex constraints
(NonEmptyVec Int complex-nat (:given proof-of-nonzero))
```

Constraint encoding through refined types:
```
; Define refined types that encode constraints
(deftype Nat-Positive () 
    Nat 
    (:constraint-proof (p : (Id Bool (> self Nat.zero) Bool.true))))

; CIF becomes automatically pure when using refined types
(deftype PositiveVec ((A : Type) (n : Nat-Positive))
    (Array A))  ; No constraint needed - encoded in parameter type
```

The compiler automatically determines CIF purity based on:
- Static availability of constraint proofs
- Purity of underlying type constructors
- Explicit proof parameters provided at call site
- Refinement types that encode constraints in the type system

**Algebraic Effect System**
- Separation of computational logic from effect handling
- Type-safe non-local control flow through effects and handlers
- ConstructionFailure as primary error handling mechanism for type construction
- User-defined effects with operation declarations and handlers

**Scheme-like LISP Syntax**
- S-expression based syntax for ease of parsing and metaprogramming
- Homoiconic representation enabling powerful syntactic abstractions
- Hygienic macro system for language extension and experimentation
- Case-sensitive identifiers and minimalist design philosophy

**Strong Static Guarantees**
- Compile-time error detection through HoTT principles
- Propositions as types (logical propositions represented as types)
- Path-based reasoning about program equivalence
- Separation of effectful construction logic from pure computational logic
