⏺ Excellent question! This gets at a fundamental design decision. Let me explain why we need a PathFinder dialect rather than directly lowering to standard MLIR dialects:

  1. Evidence Preservation

  The most critical reason - standard MLIR dialects have no concept of computational evidence:

  // What we need (PathFinder dialect)
  %result = pf.nat_elim %m, %b, %s, %n
    {termination = #pf.termination<steps: 100>,
     complexity = #pf.linear<factor: 2>} : !pf.nat

  // What standard dialects offer (no evidence!)
  // Would have to lower to loops, losing all our proofs
  scf.while %cond {
    // No termination guarantee
    // No complexity bounds
    // Just... hope it works?
  }

  2. Compile-Time Computation Semantics

  Our runtime-at-compile-time optimization needs special handling:

  // PathFinder dialect - explicit compile-time computation
  %result = pf.compute_at_compile_time {
    %0 = pf.nat_elim ...  // Can be interpreted
  } cache_key("sha256:...") : !pf.nat

  // Standard MLIR - no concept of "evaluate this at compile time"
  // Would just generate runtime code

  3. HoTT Semantics Don't Map to Standard Dialects

  Our core operations have rich mathematical meaning:

  ;; nat-elim is:
  ;; - A proof principle
  ;; - A computation strategy
  ;; - A termination guarantee
  ;; - All in one operation!

  Standard dialects would force us to choose:
  - scf dialect: Loses the proof aspect
  - affine dialect: Loses the computation aspect
  - llvm dialect: Loses everything but machine code

  4. Multi-Stage Lowering Benefits

  Having our own dialect enables progressive lowering:

  PathFinder Source
      ↓
  PathFinder IR (with full evidence)
      ↓
  PathFinder MLIR Dialect (evidence as attributes)
      ↓ [Optimize with evidence]
      ↓ [Compile-time evaluation]
      ↓ [Cache computations]
  Standard MLIR Dialects (after optimization)
      ↓
  LLVM IR / JavaScript / WASM

  If we went directly to standard dialects, we'd lose the middle optimization layer.

  5. Pattern Matching on Our Semantics

  MLIR's pattern rewriting works best with domain-specific operations:

  // We can write patterns like:
  Pattern {
    %r = pf.nat_elim %m, %base, %step, %zero
  } => {
    %r = %base  // We know nat_elim on zero returns base!
  }

  // Without our dialect, this optimization is impossible

  6. Future HoTT Features

  We'll need even more custom semantics for:

  // Path types
  %path = pf.path_type %A, %x, %y : !pf.type<1>

  // Univalence
  %equiv = pf.univalence %proof : !pf.path

  // Higher inductive types
  %hit = pf.higher_inductive "Circle" {...}

  These have no analog in standard dialects.

  The Right Approach

  Our strategy follows MLIR best practices:

  1. Domain-Specific Dialect First: Capture your language's semantics precisely
  2. Progressive Lowering: Lower to standard dialects after optimization
  3. Preserve Information: Keep evidence/types as long as possible
  4. Optimize at Right Level: Do PathFinder-specific optimizations in PathFinder dialect

  Example: What Happens Without Our Dialect

  If we tried to lower directly to standard MLIR:

  ;; PathFinder
  (nat-elim (fn (_) Nat) 0 (fn (n rec) (succ rec)) x)

  ;; Direct to SCF dialect - loses everything!
  %0 = arith.constant 0 : i64
  scf.for %i = 0 to %x {
    %0 = arith.addi %0, 1 : i64
  }
  // Where's the evidence? The termination proof?
  // The ability to evaluate at compile time? All gone!

  Analogy

  It's like compiling Haskell:
  - GHC has Core (like our PathFinder dialect)
  - You don't compile Haskell directly to assembly
  - Core preserves types, enables optimization
  - Only after optimization do you lower to STG → Cmm → assembly

  Our PathFinder dialect serves the same role - it's the "Core" of our compiler that preserves what makes PathFinder special until the last possible moment.

  This is why the dialect was worth implementing - it's not overhead, it's the key to making PathFinder's unique features actually work!

> That makes sense. Why aren't we doing all of the HoTT features now?
  ⎿  Interrupted by user

> Oh I remember now, we're doing a meta circular approach right where we get a bare minimum working first and then progressively enrich?

⏺ Exactly! You've got it perfectly. This is the metacircular bootstrapping strategy in action:

  The Metacircular Ladder

  We're climbing a ladder where each rung enables the next:

  1. Minimal Bootstrap (Guile) ✓
     ↓
  2. Basic IR + MLIR ✓
     ↓
  3. Compile simple PathFinder → native code (current goal)
     ↓
  4. PathFinder compiles itself (metacircular moment!)
     ↓
  5. Add advanced HoTT features using PathFinder itself
     ↓
  6. Each compilation makes the next faster/better

  Why This Order Makes Sense

  1. Minimum Viable Compiler First

  ;; What we need for self-hosting:
  - nat-elim, bool-elim ✓
  - Basic functions ✓
  - Simple effects ✓
  - Compile-time evaluation ✓

  ;; What can wait:
  - Path types
  - Univalence
  - HITs
  - Cubical features

  2. Use PathFinder to Implement PathFinder

  Once we're self-hosting, we can implement complex features IN PathFinder:

  ;; Instead of implementing paths in Guile/MLIR...
  ;; We implement them in PathFinder itself!

  (define-dialect-extension PathDialect
    (type Path (-> (A : Type) (x : A) (y : A) Type))

    (operation path-elim
      (-> (motive : (-> Path Type))
          (refl-case : (-> (x : A) (motive (refl x))))
          (path : Path A x y)
          (motive path))))

  ;; The compiler compiles its own extensions!

  3. Evidence-Aware Development

  Each layer provides evidence for the next:

  Bootstrap: "Trust me, nat-elim terminates"
      ↓
  Self-hosted: "Here's the termination proof for nat-elim"
      ↓
  Advanced: "Here's the full HoTT consistency proof"

  4. Performance Bootstrapping

  ;; Iteration 1: Slow Peano arithmetic
  (define add (fn (x y) (nat-elim ... y)))  ;; O(n)

  ;; Iteration 2: Compile-time evaluation
  (define five (add two three))  ;; Computed at compile time!

  ;; Iteration 3: Generate machine arithmetic
  %0 = add i64 %x, %y  ;; O(1) single instruction!

  The Beautiful Part

  This is exactly how many languages were bootstrapped:

  - C: First C compiler written in assembly, then rewritten in C
  - OCaml: Bootstrapped from Caml Light
  - Rust: Bootstrapped from OCaml, then self-hosted

  But PathFinder is unique because:

  1. Mathematical Foundation: Each stage is provably correct
  2. Evidence Preservation: We never lose information
  3. Compile-Time Power: Each iteration can do more at compile time
  4. HoTT Native: Advanced type theory features become natural

  Current Focus

  Right now we need:
  ;; Can PathFinder compile this?
  (define compiler-main
    (fn (source)
      (let ((ast (parse source)))
        (let ((ir (ast-to-ir ast)))
          (let ((mlir (ir-to-mlir ir)))
            (let ((native (mlir-to-native mlir)))
              native))))))

  ;; If yes → we're self-hosting!
  ;; If no → what's missing?

  What Comes After Self-Hosting

  Once PathFinder compiles itself:

  1. Path Types: Implement equality proofs
  2. Univalence: Type equivalence = equality
  3. HITs: Higher inductive types
  4. Cubical: Full cubical type theory
  5. Quotients: Proper quotient types
  6. ∞-Topoi: The full HoTT dream

  But crucially - we implement these IN PathFinder, not in the bootstrap!

  This metacircular approach is why we can start simple and still reach the full power of HoTT. It's not a compromise - it's the optimal path!
